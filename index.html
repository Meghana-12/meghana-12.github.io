          <br />
          I‚Äôm a Full Stack developer based out of India with a BTech in CSE
          from the <b>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhilai</b>. My Primary skill set includes <b>ReactJS with TypeScript, Tailwind, styled components, React Query</b> in the Frontend. And for backend I'm comfortable with  <b>NodeJS & PostgreSQL</b>.

          In my current role at Needl AI, I've played a pivotal role in
          developing and launching innovative features, enhancing user

          <b>integration of third-party payment systems</b> to building full stack
          features in React JS NodeJS and PostgreSQL, I excel in delivering
          impactful solutions, taking full ownership of every feature I develop.

          evidenced by my participation in programs like <b>Microsoft Engage</b>,
          wins in international Hackathons & opensource contributions . Furthermore, I have taken on leadership roles at IIT Bhilai, <b>General Secretary of Cultural Affairs (2019-2020)</b> providing me with valuable management experience.
