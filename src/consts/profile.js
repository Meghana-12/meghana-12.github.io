    Iâ€™m a Full Stack developer based out of India, with a BTech in CSE from the
    Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhilai. With a solid foundation in
    technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS & PostgreSQL, I specialize in crafting
    robust solutions for complex problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    In my current role at Needl AI, I've played a pivotal role in developing and
    launching innovative features, enhancing user experience, and optimizing
    backend processes. From spearheading the integration of third-party payment
    systems to building full stack features in React JS NodeJS and PostgreSQL, I
    excel in delivering impactful solutions, taking full ownership of every
    feature I develop.
    <br />
    <br />
    My journey extends beyond the confines of traditional development, as
    evidenced by my participation in programs like Microsoft Engage and
    successful collaborations in hackathons, where my team secured top
    positions. Furthermore, I have taken on leadership roles at IIT Bhilai,
    providing me with valuable management experience.
