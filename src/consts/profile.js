const DESCRIPTION = (
  <>
    &nbsp;I've got hands-on experience in full-stack development. On the
    front-end, I'm familiar with&nbsp;
    <i>
      <b>TypeScript</b>
    </i>
    &nbsp;and React Query, while on the back-end, I've worked extensively with
    Node.js and PostgreSQL.
    <br />
    <br />
    Over the past few years, I've delved into a range of web development
    technologies, exploring React, Redux, and Saga, as well as dynamic CSS,
    component CSS, and good old vanilla CSS. Handling APIs has been a
    fundamental part of my journey. I've also gained practical experience
    through internships in the same field.
    <br /> <br />
    Beyond coding, I've excelled in diverse roles - from being the&nbsp;
    <i>
      <b>General Secretary of Cultural Affairs</b>
    </i>
    &nbsp;to participating actively in hackathons, mentoring, and contributing
    to open-source projects. And if you think development is the only thing I
    do, darling, you got me all wrong, I play guitar, make art and more
    importantly have fun :D
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Thanks for visiting, and have a wonderful day! ðŸŒŸ</b>
